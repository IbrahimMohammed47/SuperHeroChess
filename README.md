# SuperHeroChessGame

Super Hero Chess is a chess-like board game. pieces are characters that have some special powers instead of the special moves of the ordinary chess.
This java-based game was a project i did in my university to apply what i learnt about OOP concepts, i also added some additional features that i will mention in Contents.

## Who is this game for 
  - For anyone who wants to learn about OOP. 
  - For anyone who might find this game fun (which i clearly doubt).
  - For my future employer who will accept my resume when he/she sees this wonderful project XD.
  
## Contents
  - OOP concepts (Inheritance - Polymorphism - Abstraction - Encapsulation ).
  - Exception Handling. 
  - Files & I/O.
  - GUI ( the game has an isometric orientation). 
  - Logic.
  
## Issues 
The game has some bugs especially when it comes to rendering, it also has a poor choice of controls and it's quite bad when it comes to the design part( colors, characters...). But anyway, that wasn't the purpose of the project. I'll try to fix those bugs when i have enough time :).
